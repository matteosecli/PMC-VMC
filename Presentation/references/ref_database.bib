abstract = {The C++ language is often used for implementing functionality that is performance and/or resource sensitive. While the standard C++ library provides many useful algorithms (such as sorting), in its current form it does not provide direct handling of linear algebra (matrix maths). Armadillo is an open source linear algebra library for the C++ language, aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Its high-level Application Programming Interface (API) is deliberately similar to the widely Matlab and Octave languages (Eaton et al. 2015), so that mathematical operations can be expressed in a familiar and natural manner. The library is useful for algorithm development directly in C++, or relatively quick conversion of research code into production environments. Armadillo provides efficient objects for vectors, matrices and cubes (third order tensors), as well as over 200 associated functions for manipulating data stored in the objects. Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as dense and sparse storage formats. Various matrix factorisations are provided through integration with LAPACK (Demmel 1997), or one of its high performance drop-in replacements such as Intel MKL (Intel 2016) or OpenBLAS (Xianyi, Qian, and Saar 2016). It is also possible to use Armadillo in conjunction with NVBLAS to obtain GPU-accelerated matrix multiplication (NVIDIA 2015). Armadillo is used as a base for other open source projects, such as MLPACK, a C++ library for machine learning and pattern recognition (Curtin et al. 2013), and RcppArmadillo, a bridge between the R language and C++ in order to speed up computations (Eddelbuettel and Sanderson 2014). Armadillo internally employs an expression evaluator based on template meta-programming techniques (Abrahams and Gurtovoy 2004), to automatically combine several operations in order to increase speed and efficiency. An overview of the internal architecture is given in (Sanderson 2010).},

abstract = {Exactly solvable models are very important in physics from a theoretical point of view and also from the experimentalist's perspective, because in such cases theoretical results and experimental results can be compared without ambiguity. This is a book about an important class of exactly solvable models in physics. The subject area is the Bethe-ansatz approach for a number of one-dimensional models, and the setting up of equations within this approach to determine the thermodynamics of these systems. It is a topic that crosses the boundaries among condensed matter physics, mathematics and field theory. The derivation and application of thermodynamic Bethe-ansatz equations for one-dimensional models are explained in detail. This technique is indispensable for physicists studying the low-temperature properties of one-dimensional substances. Written by the originator of much of the work in the subject, this book will be of great interest to theoretical condensed matter physicists.},

abstract = {The spin-½ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice is used to describe the dynamics of the spin degrees of freedom of undoped copper oxides. Even though the model lacks an exact solution, a solid, accurate, and rather conventional picture emerges from a number of techniques—analytical (spin-wave theory, Schwinger boson mean-field theory, renormalization-group calculations), semianalytical (variational theory, series expansions), and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, etc.). At zero temperature, the effect of the zero-point fluctuations is not strong enough to destroy the antiferromagnetic long-range order, despite the fact that we are dealing with a low-spin low-dimensional system. The corrections to the spin-wave theory, which treats perturbatively the effect of such fluctuations around the classical N{\'{e}}el ground state, appear to be small.

The good agreement of the experimental data with the predictions of this theory suggests that the magnetic state of the undoped materials is the conventional ordered state. We discuss, within a simple mean-field theory, the effect of weak three-dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling and the role of an antisymmetric term, introduced to explain a hidden ferromagnetic behavior of the uniform susceptibility. We find that understanding the copper-oxide antiferromagnetic insulator is only the first essential step towards the development of a theory of the superconductor created upon doping such materials.},

We employ the Bethe ansatz to calculate matrix elements and show how the results of such a calculation can be used to predict lineshapes for neutron scattering experiments on quasi-1D antiferromagnetic compounds.
